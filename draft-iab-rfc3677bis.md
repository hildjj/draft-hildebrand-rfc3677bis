# Introduction        {#introduction}

The Internet Society (ISOC) provides organizational and financial
support for the IETF. As stipulated in {{ISOC-By-Laws}} (and originally
specified in {{RFC3677}}) the IETF is called upon to name Trustees to its
Board (BoT), with staggered 3 year terms.  In general, this requires
that the IETF name one or more Trustees each year.

This memo outlines the process by which the IETF makes that
selection.  This process will also be used in the event of mid-term
vacancies that may arise with IETF nominated Board positions.

## Overview of Selection Process   {#overview}

In brief, this document describes the timeframe and procedures for
the IAB to solicit public input and make a selection for the open
position each year.

## Rationale   {#rationale}

An alternative approach to making a selection for these positions
would be to use the IETF's NomCom ({{RFC7437}} and its revisions).
However, that NomCom is chartered and defined specifically to the
task of making selections for IETF organization tasks, and the ISOC
BoT appointment process does not fit that in 2 ways:

1.  the timeframe of the appointment does not mesh with the IETF
    appointment cycle

2.  the nature of the deliberations and the type of information
    solicited would be significantly different for an external
    appointment, such as this appointment to the ISOC BoT

The first issue (timing) could be resolved fairly easily for this
specific appointment.  The second issue is more general, and not
reasonably reconciled with the IETF NomCom task as currently
specified.

The process described in {{RFC7437}} is oriented toward soliciting
feedback from the IETF community with respect to individuals and
technical positions with which they have personal experience.  To
make a good decision on external appointments, in general, the NomCom
would have to understand the requirements for those positions, and
attempt to evaluate candidates for a very different set of skills
than is required of IAB/IESG members.  It might also require
soliciting feedback from outside the IETF community.   There is no
question that the individuals that constitute the IETF NomCom each
year have the competence to carry out such a search; the issue is
that it is a very different task, would require additional time and
resources, and therefore is a side effort that could very well
undermine the effectiveness of the NomCom in carrying out its primary
task for the IETF.

By contrast, the IAB is chartered to be responsible for IETF external
liaisons, is a standing body that works with ISOC (and the ISOC
Board), and therefore has a working knowledge of the requirements of
the specific position discussed here.

At some future point, if there is a more general need to make
external appointments, the IETF may consider broadening the scope of
the IETF NomCom role, or create a separate nominating committee for
such external non-liaison appointments.  This document proposes that
is not necessary or desirable for the purposes of this one annual
appointment.

# Desirable Qualifications and Selection Criteria for an IETF-Nominated ISOC Trustee

Candidates for an ISOC Trustee should have a demonstrable involvement
in the IETF with a particular focus on active participation in IETF
Working Groups.

The candidate is expected to possess clearly demonstrated technical
competence in Internet technology, and be able to articulate
technology issues such that the ISOC Board can be provided with sound
technical perspectives.  The candidate is also expected to be able to
understand the respective roles and responsibilities of the IETF and
ISOC and be able to articulate these roles within both organizational
communities.

The candidate will also be expected to exercise all the duties of an
ISOC Board member, including fiduciary responsibility, setting of
policies, oversight of the operation of the Society,  representing
the interests of the members and stakeholders of the Society and
participation in all Board meetings and Board activity programs.

The candidate is not a representative or a delegate of the IETF and
is not chartered to represent the IETF or the IETF Standards Process
within the ISOC Board or the broader ISOC community.  However it is
expected that the candidate would be able to call on experts in the
IETF community as required, to ensure that the ISOC Board receives
the highest quality technical advice available.

# IETF ISOC Board of Trustees Selection Process

## Nominations and Eligibility

Each year, the IAB will make a public call for nominations on the
ietf-announce@ietf.org mailing list.  The public call will specify
the manner by which nominations will be accepted and the means by
which the list of nominees will be published.

Self-nominations are permitted.  Along with the name and contact
information for each candidate, details about the candidate's
background and qualifications for the position should be attached to
the nomination.  All IETF participants, including working group
chairs, IETF NomCom members, IAB and IESG members are eligible for
nomination.

IAB and IESG members who accept nomination will recuse themselves
from selection and confirmation discussions respectively.

## Selection

The IAB will publish the list of nominated persons, review the
nomination material, and make a selection.

The selection criteria will include additional consideration of any
nominated candidates who are concurrently members of the IAB or the IESG
such that at the time of selection no more than two of the
four IETF-appointed ISOC Trustees are IAB and IESG members.

## Confirmation

The IESG will act as the confirming body for the selection.  In the
event that the IESG determines not to confirm the nominated
candidate, the IESG will provide the IAB with the basis for this
determination and the IAB will nominate another candidate.

## Timeframe

ISOC expects to seat new Board members at its annual general meeting
in June of each year.  Basic timeframe requirements for the IETF
process are as follows:

* 4-6 weeks for solicitation of nominations

* 4-6 weeks for review of nominees, deliberation and selection

* 4-6 weeks for confirmation (and re-selection as necessary) and
  delivery to ISOC

In January of each year, the IAB will announce the specific dates for
the IETF ISOC Trustee selection process for that year (taking into
account the particular dates of the first IETF meeting of the year,
etc), following the guidelines above.

### Timing of Fourth Appointment {#timing-fourth}

There was a change to the ISOC by-laws in 2013 such that the IAB appoints
a total of four Board members, with that change taking effect in 2015.  Every
third year, the IAB will appoint two ISOC Board members instead of one.

For clarity, this means the following number of Board members will be appointed
in the given years:

* 2015: 2
* 2016: 1
* 2017: 1
* 2018: 2
* 2019: 1
* 2020: 1
* etc.

### Further Changes to Number and Timing of Appointments {#further-changes}

If ISOC further modifies {{ISOC-By-Laws}} concerning the number of IAB
appointments to the ISOC Board or the timing thereof, the IAB will make
reasonable modifications to the processes embodied in this document, without
requiring further modification to this document.  Such changes will be
announced via an IAB statement.

## Mid-term Vacancies

This document describes the process for the general, annual
appointment of ISOC Trustees to fill the seats of Trustees whose
terms are ending.  However, if an IETF-appointed Trustee is unable to
serve his or her full term, the IAB may, at its discretion,
immediately select a replacement to serve the remainder of the term
using the interim process defined in {{interim}}.  If the IAB does
not invoke the interim process, the next annual selection process
will fill the vacancy (if the vacant term does not end at that point)
as well as the regular appointment for that selection cycle.

### Interim Appointment Process {#interim}

If the IAB elects to fill the mid-term vacancy before the next annual
selection, a separate timeline will be announced and the rest of the
process described in this document will be followed.
